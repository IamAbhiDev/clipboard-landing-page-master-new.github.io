## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I got the opportunity to learn more about planning my layout and making it more responsive. I struggled to make the footer responsive for the desktop while keeping it pixel-perfect at the same time. But somehow, I managed to do the task.

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to keep focusing on making the layout more responsive because I still feel like I could have done a better job while making it responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io) - This chrome extension helped me run automated checks to test the accessibility of the site.
